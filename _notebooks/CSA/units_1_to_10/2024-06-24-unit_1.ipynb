    "## Memory Allocation: Stack and Heap\n",
    "In Java, memory allocation for variables occurs in two main areas: the stack and the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Memory\n",
    "- Used for storing primitive data types and references to objects.\n",
    "- Memory is allocated in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.\n",
    "- Each thread has its own stack, ensuring thread safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int number = 100; // Stored in the stack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used for storing objects and arrays.\n",
    "- Shared among all threads, requiring synchronization for thread safety.\n",
    "- Managed by the garbage collector, which reclaims memory when objects are no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String message = new String(\"Hello\"); // `message` reference in stack, actual object in heap\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refrence Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference types in Java include classes, arrays, and interfaces. Unlike primitive types, reference types store addresses (references) to objects rather than the objects themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "- Create complex data structures by grouping variables and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    String name;\n",
    "    int age;\n",
    "}\n",
    "Person person = new Person(); // `person` reference in stack, `Person` object in heap\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Arrays\n",
    "- Collections of variables of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] numbers = new int[5]; // `numbers` reference in stack, array in heap\n",
